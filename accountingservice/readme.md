# Accounting Service
A example micro service demonstrating simple and more advanced Spring Security
concepts to protect (web / rest) services.

## Security basics and definitions
Security - or better securing an application - is a wide area and filled with plenty of different concepts, a few advanced topics 
like OAuth2 will be covered here, but some are out of scope. 
To begin with we define the terms used, not only in Spring Security, and then we provide some examples:

### Definitions
#### Authentication
According to Wikipedia authentication _is the act of confirming the truth of an attribute of a single piece of data claimed true by an entity. In contrast with identification, which refers to the act of stating or otherwise indicating a claim purportedly attesting to a person or thing's identity, authentication is the process of actually confirming that identity_

For securing (web) apps it mostly breaks down to 2 common types
1. **single-factor authentication**: where the user normally provides her user name and password to proof his identity.
2. **two-factor authentication**: an additional level of security by using additional information, 
e.g. using Google Authenticator where the user first provides her username/password and then needs to input an additional digit from the Authenticator app

#### Authorization    
Authorization is the function of specifying access rights/privileges to resources related to information 
security and computer security in general and to access control in particular. More formally, "to authorize" is to define an access policy

Authorization can be done in a couple of ways 
1. **Role based access control (RBAC) / Role based security**: Often used and simple, but often a good choice for small apps. 
The security decisions is based on one or more roles associated to a user (principal), e.g. ADMIN role that allows
2. **Permission based**: Allows fine-grained access control on methods/actions and provides a good way to manage permissions, roles and complex security scenarios. 
3. **Access Control list (ACL)**: fine-grained access control on domain objects (not only methods / actions), e.g. database entries, i.e. entity instances of a row

#### CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)


### Spring Security Concepts
Here a definition of the most important core concepts of Spring Security:

1. SecurityContextHolder, to provide access to the SecurityContext.
2. SecurityContext, to hold the Authentication and possibly request-specific security information.
3. Authentication, to represent the principal in a Spring Security-specific manner.
4. GrantedAuthority, to reflect the application-wide permissions granted to a principal, e.g. ADMIN role.
5. UserDetails, to provide the necessary information to build an Authentication object from your applicationâ€™s DAOs or other source of security data.
6. UserDetailsService, to create a UserDetails when passed in a String-based username (or certificate ID or the like). 
7. AccessDecisionManager, main interface responsible for making access-control decisions
8. Authentication, object representing the principal requesting access, 
a "secure object" and a list of security metadata attributes which apply for the object (such as a list of roles which are required for access to be granted).  



## Overview of Spring Security (modules)
The Spring Security project consists of several modules with a 
specific use case that can be included if needed.

### Core: spring-security-core.jar
Contains all required classes and interfaces and is needed
by every project using Spring Security.

### Web: spring-security-web.jar
Filters and web-security infrastructure code.
Needed for securing anything with Servlet API, e.g.
URL-based access-control.

### Config: spring-security-config.jar
Module for configuration of Spring Security (XML or Java config).

### OAuth 2.0 Core, Client, JOSE
Support for industry-standard protocol for authorization.

Details will be provided in this example project and can also 
be found here: https://oauth.net/2/

### LDAP: spring-security-ldap.jar
LDAP authentication and provisioning code.

### ACL: spring-security-acl.jar
Specialized domain object access control list implementation, 
allowing fine-grained security on domain objects, e.g. entity instances.

### Test - spring-security-test.jar
Support for testing with Spring security.
